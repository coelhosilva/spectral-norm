# spectral-norm

This code is an alternate solution to the spectral-norm program available on the [The Computer Language Benchmarks Game website](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/description/spectralnorm.html#spectralnorm) [1], and originally featured as the third challenge of the Hundred-Dollar, Hundred-Digit Challenge Problems [2].

The goal of this solution was to develop a program that takes advantage of Python libraries such as NumPy so a comparison with pure Python and other programming languages can be made.
